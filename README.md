   - Allow students to enroll in predefined courses (`JAVA`, `DSA`, `DEVOPS`, `SELENIUM`).
   - Prevent duplicate course enrollment.

6. **Input Validation**:
   - Validate names, IDs, and courses.
   - Ensure robust error handling for invalid inputs.

7. **Console-based Menu**:
   - Simple interactive interface to navigate through the options.
